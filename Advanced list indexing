#Demo 1

#ouput is [20,50,5]


#Demo 2

list=[20,40,50,30,5,10]
named_slice = slice(5, None)  # this is equivalent to [5:]
print(list[named_slice])

#output will be 10



#Demo 3

x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
new_slice = slice(3, 8, 2)   #This is equivalent to [3:8:2]
print(x[new_slice])

#This will give output has [4,6,8]
